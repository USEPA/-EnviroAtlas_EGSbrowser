There are many species of wetland plants with varying transpiration rates including those found on croplands, forested woody wetlands, and natural land cover.

While there are many types of wetlands, peatlands represent an ecosystem that can serve as a sink for sulfur (Mikutta, C. and Rothwell, J.J., 2016). Sulfur is an important mineral because of its ability to bind to arsenic, which is a source of air contamination that contributes to issues with human health (Mikutta, C. and Rothwell, J.J., 2016; Langner, P., Mikutta, C., Kretzschmar, R., 2012; IPCS, 2001). Arsenics gaseous form originates from natural sources, such as volcanic ash, and human sources, such as metal smelting operations (IPCS, 2001). When arsenic is in the air, it attaches to particulate matter and falls to the earth in either wet or dry deposition (IPCS, 2001). If the arsenic falls onto a wetland, it can adsorb into the soil preventing it from returning to the atmosphere. ",

Once these gases transform, the wetlands release the oxygen back into the atmosphere. Additionally, wetland plants with a high transpiration rate are most efficient at removing toxins from the air. The rate of transpiration is important because it describes the ability of a plant to evaporate water back into the atmosphere, which is an important source of clean oxygen.",

Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act (Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, n.d.). These gases come from human activity (e.g., fossil fuel fired power plants), animals (e.g., manure), and even wetlands themselves (Olsson, L. et al., 2015). Wetlands produce greenhouse gases because they are important ecosystems that adsorb and store organic materials like carbon, also known as carbon sequestration (Olsson, L. et al., 2015; Nui, X., Wang, B., and Wei, W., 2016; Mikutta, C. and Rothwell, J.J., 2016). Carbon sequestration happens because wetlands are full of plant varieties and autotrophic microorganisms. These plants and autotrophic microorganisms create their own food from using carbon dioxide or light energy (i.e., photosynthesis). This use of carbon dioxide is what fixes the greenhouse gas into the wetland (Olsson, L., 2015). While there are many types of wetlands (e.g., croplands, forested woody), peat bogs are particularly important for carbon sequestration because water saturates them and slows down microbe activity and decomposition rates (Nui, X., Wang, B., and Wei, W., 2016). This means that carbon is stored for a longer period, reducing the presence of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.  ",

Shade is supplied by the wetland canopies and can have a different effect for various land use types (Wei, Jingang, and Yubi, 2015; McLaughlin and Cohen, 2013; Shaw and Bible, 1996). In urban areas, shade from the canopies help cool the environment (Wei, Jingang, and Yubi, 2015; McLaughlin and Cohen, 2013; Shaw and Bible, 1996). Wetland plants may also have a role in climate stabilization because they supply oxygen (Poindexter and Variano, 2013; Laanbroek, 2010). One study found that oxygen is an important factor in climate forcing throughout geologic time (Poulsen, Tabor, and White, 2015). Since wetlands release oxygen through photosynthesis and the transpiration of water, they could play an even more vital role in climate stabilization other than just providing shade (Pokorn, Kvt, Rejkov, and Brom, 2010; Gutowski, Wei, Vrsmarty, and Fekete, 2007).

Evapotranspiration provided by wetlands plays an important role in climate stabilization because the process affects the microclimate (Zhang, Zhu and Jiang, 2016; McLaughlin and Cohen, 2013). Wetlands in urban areas are especially important because they alleviate the heat island effect (McLaughlin and Cohen, 2013). The heat island effect is when urban areas are hotter due to trapping heat. Vegetation, like wetlands, can help reduce the heat by turning water from a liquid to a vapor. Water released as a vapor helps cool sites (Pokorn, Kvt, Rejkov, and Brom, 2010).    ",

One study found that depressional wetlands can sequester a net amount of greenhouse gas to 3.2 Mg of carbon dioxide per hectare (Gala and Young, 2015). Another study found that mangroves in India sequestered about 1.5 tonne of carbon per hectare per year (Bassi, Kumar, Sharma, and Pardha-Saradhi, 2014). Sequestration is the ability of wetland plants and autotrophic organisms to fix carbon dioxide through photosynthesis (Olsson et al., 2015). By doing this, carbon dioxide gets transformed to organic compounds locked away from the atmosphere (Olsson et al., 2015). Wetlands are important sinks of carbon because they have accumulated one-third of the global terrestrial carbon (Keller, 2011). In addition, wetlands regulate the microclimate of urban and rural land cover types (Zhang, Zhu, and Jiang, 2016). These ecosystems play an important role of stabilizing the microclimate in all seasons due to their ability to store heat and perform evapotranspiration (Zhang, Zhu, and Jiang, 2016; Pokorn, Kvt, Rejkov, and Brom, 2010).

The process of plants using carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen is photosynthesis. Oxygen also leaves these ecosystems through transpiration, which is the loss of water vapor from wetland leaves (Shoemaker, W.B. et al., 2015; Huryna, H., Brom, J., and Pokorny, J, 2014).

Subsidence is the collapsing of soil and rock mostly due to human activities including the extraction and draining of water. The collapse of soils is accelerating the loss of wetlands (Sidle, Benson, Carriger, and Kamai, 2013). This loss reduces the number of wetlands that can provide clean air services to mitigate natural hazards like volcanic eruptions. The draining of wetlands also creates a risk for existing landowners who rely on the foundation these ecosystems provide for coastal properties (Sidle, Benson, Carriger, and Kamai, 2013).
