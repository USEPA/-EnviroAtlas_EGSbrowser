ecosystem:
	This ecosystem includes (but is not limited to) this #ECOSYSTEM_TX#. It is one of 15 Environmental Classes described within the Final Ecosystem Goods and Services Classification System (FEGS-CS).

[BENEFIT_CATEGORIES_TEXT] 
Biodiversity:
	Biodiversity is the variety of all forms of life and it is essential to the existence and proper functioning of all ecosystems. Biodiversity supports habitats for all species by providing many unique environments in which species can exist; these include ecosystems of all types and sizes, rare ecosystems, and corridors between habitats. Many scientists believe biodiversity, as it represents all forms of life on earth, provides or supports the core benefits that humans derive from their environment. Biodiversity is fundamental for the provision of ecosystem services, which we depend on for food, air, and water security, and multiple other natural benefits.


Clean Air:
	The natural production and maintenance of clean air is important for overall human health and well-being.
	The earth around us naturally provides clean air that is produced from a series of complex interactions between the land and atmosphere. Forests, for example, absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen.
	To help produce clean air, natural resources such as wetlands, trees, and soil, filter many pollutants from our air. Some of these pollutants include carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), and nitrogen oxides (NOx).
	The ability of an ecosystem to filter pollutants from the air varies by region, topography, season/climate, ecosystem type, ecosystem fragmentation or connectivity, and the species composition of that system.
	Local weather and topography affect how air pollutants may disperse, and certain types of trees, such as conifers and deciduous broadleaf species, are particularly efficient at pollutant removal.

Clean and Plentiful Waters:
	Available clean water is critical to the health of people, the environment, and the economy. Ecosystems such as rivers, lakes, and streams provide roughly 80 percent of usable freshwater, while the remaining water comes mostly from underground wells.
	Vegetated land cover helps regulate the flow of water through a watershedby intercepting, absorbing, and slowly releasing water. This "sponge" effect can reduce adverse impacts such as stream bank erosion, sediment transport, and the frequency and severity of floods and drought.
	Natural resources such as wetlands, stream buffers, and vegetated land cover can also naturally filter out pollutants such as metals, pesticides, sediment, and overabundant nutrients that may affect water quality.
	The efficiency of ecosystems to filter pollutants depends on many biological and physical characteristics, including species composition, soil types, slope, and climate characteristics.
	Natural land cover helps maintain the flow and usability of water resources so that they remain clean and abundant for sustainable use by current and future generations.

Climate_Stabilization:
	The earth's climate is constantly changing on geologic time scales ranging from centuries to thousands of millennia (e.g., periods of wide-spread volcanism, cooling or ice ages, etc.).
	Most species, including humans, have evolved or adapted to survive and flourish under such slowly changing patterns of temperature and precipitation averages, variability, and extremes. 
	Recently, these patterns have been changing more rapidly in response to increased levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere.
	GHGs trap heat in the atmosphere in the same way that heat is trapped in a horticultural greenhouse.
	Healthy, properly functioning ecosystems, and natural resources such as soils, oceans and vegetation, can reduce or stabilize this rate of change through the long-term capture and storage of carbon. This process is known as carbon sequestrationHelpcarbon sequestrationThe uptake and storage of carbon. Trees and plants, for example, absorb carbon dioxide, release the oxygen and store the carbon. Fossil fuels were at one time biomass and continue to store the carbon until burned. See carbon sinks..
	Sequestering atmospheric CO2 in natural resources called sinks reduces the amount of CO2 that is available to heat the atmosphere and potentially increase climate instability. 
	The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that the world's oceans have taken up 500 gigatons (Gt) of atmospheric CO2 out of 1300 Gt CO2 total human-caused emissions in the past 200 years1.
	Along with soils and oceans, both below-ground (e.g., roots) and above-ground (e.g., leaves) vegetation store carbon (average of 53.5 tons of carbon per hectare for U.S. forests)2.
	On a smaller scale, vegetation can mitigate climate variability and extremes by creating local micro-climates through shading and increased humidity, producing a more favorable environment for humans and wildlife.
	By storing carbon and modifying local climate conditions, our natural resources provide a means to stabilize rapidly changing climate conditions.

Food_Fuel_and_Materials:
	Humans depend on provisioning services, such as food, fuel, timber, and other materials which are provided by a combination of functioning ecosystems, human innovation, and technology.
	Ecosystems provide the conditions necessary for commercial food production as well as for subsistence living.
	The demand for these life-sustaining services increases as the population continues to grow. Between 1960 and 2000, global food production increased by roughly two-and-a half times, wood harvests for pulp and paper production tripled, installed hydropower capacity doubled, and timber production increased by more than half.1
	Productive soils, a favorable climate, and clean and abundant water resources are all essential for growing crops, raising livestock, and for ecosystems to continue to provide the critical provisioning services that humans need.
	Biodiversity underpins these services; without variation in plants and organisms, the multitude of available food crops and game species would not exist. Abundant water resources are also central to the production of energy and most of the material goods that people enjoy.
	Adequate pollinator habitat is also necessary for many types of crops.

Natural Hazard Mitigation:
	Weather-related natural hazards, such as floods, fires, heat extremes, droughts, and hurricanes can potentially devastate large numbers of people, property, crops, and natural resources.
	Healthy ecosystems and good agricultural practices benefit humans in many ways, including helping to mitigate some of the effects of these natural hazards.
	Though fire is an essential part of the natural cycle, it can have significant consequences; forest and rangeland management help ensure a healthy fire cycle while reducing the impacts on human health.
	Vegetated land cover intercepts and absorbs water, retaining it and slowing its movement, helping to reduce flooding and its subsequent effects. Vegetated stream buffers help absorb water along streams and rivers, which also reduces flooding by holding excess water. These buffers are especially important in urban areas where significant amounts of stormwater runoff can inundate streams during precipitation events.
	Coral reefs and coastal marshes offer shoreline protection in coastal regions and help reduce the impacts of storms, including erosion, by acting as a physical barrier and reducing wind and wave energy.
	Vegetative cover is also important for reducing temperatures on micro- and macro-scales. Vegetation helps to shade areas and reduce surface temperatures, mitigating the potential public health effects of extreme heat.
	Maintaining cover crops over soils and limiting tillage helps minimize the impact of drought on crops.
	Without the protection provided by natural resources and ecosystems, the detrimental effects of natural hazards would likely be more catastrophic.

Recreation:
	People enjoy spending time in outdoor environments such as natural areas, parks, forests, and other green spaces.
	Each year in the U.S., hundreds of millions of people visit protected lands, such as National Parks, National Forests, National Monuments, National Recreation Areas, National Wildlife Refuges, National Wild and Scenic Rivers, and National Historic Sites. In 2012, the National Park system alone had over 282 million recreational visits.
	Outdoor spaces provide opportunities for recreation, adventure, and physical activity. These spaces are important simply because they are unique places that exist. They are also appreciated for their cultural significance, beauty, educational value, abundance of diverse plants and wildlife, and the sense of place they provide.
	Recreation and tourism associated with outdoor environments can play a huge role in local economies. 
	Many groups place high value on historically or culturally important landscapes or on individual species because of their societal significance. Many religions also attach spiritual and religious values to ecosystems or their components
